# SwiftUI Projects â€“ 100 Days of SwiftUI

Welcome to my **SwiftUI Projects** repository!  
This repository contains the apps and projects I created while following the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) course by Paul Hudson.

Each project is organized into its own folder named by the day and project title. This is my first attempt at building SwiftUI apps, and I am excited to share my learning journey.

## Projects List

- **Day01 - WeSplit**

- **Day02 - Temperature Converter**  
  An app to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

- **Day03 - Temperature Converter**  
  Guessing the countries flags.

*(More projects to come as I progress through the course.)*

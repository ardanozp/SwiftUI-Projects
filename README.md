# SwiftUI Projects â€“ 100 Days of SwiftUI

Welcome to my **SwiftUI Projects** repository!  
This repository contains the apps and projects I created while following the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) course by Paul Hudson.

Each project is organized into its own folder named by the day and project title. This is my first attempt at building SwiftUI apps, and I am excited to share my learning journey.

## About Me

This repository serves as a portfolio of my learning progress and practical experience.

## How to Use

Each folder contains a standalone SwiftUI project. You can open any folder in Xcode and run the app on a simulator or device.

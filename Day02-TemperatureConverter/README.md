# Temperature Converter 🌡️

This is a simple SwiftUI app that converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

I built this app as the first challenge from the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) course by Paul Hudson.

It's also the very first SwiftUI application I've written on my own, so it holds a special place in my learning journey. 🚀

### Features

- Input a temperature value
- Select input and output units
- Instantly see the converted result

### Tech Stack

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Xcode

Feel free to try it out or fork it if you're also starting with SwiftUI. 😄
